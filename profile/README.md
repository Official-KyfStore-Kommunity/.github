# Official KyfStore Kommunity

## Intro

Hello, KyfStore lovers! I'm glad to see you here! Welcome to the official GitHub organization for KyfStore! My discord server is [Official KyfStore](https://discord.gg/uWGM8PQ2nQ). Just answer a few questions about yourself and you're in!

## Rules

Just go to the rules channel and read me. You will also have to agree to read both of my website(s) terms and condiions: [DevKyfStore Terms](https://developers.kyfstore.com/terms-and-conditions), [KyfStore Conditions](https://kyfstore.com/terms)

## Roles

When you first join to are automatically Unverified. To verify yourself, goto the verification channel click verify and you're done! Once verified you can earn lots of roles. You start as a beginnerProgrammer and go up to legendaryProgrammer. You can learn more about this at my discord. You can also apply for higher roles like moderator. To do this just email me at [KyfStore Support Email](mailto:support@kyfstore.com). Just type in your actual name, your discord username, and your description. If you qualify, I will promote you to a higher rank! Also, you may notice there are patreon ranks! You can join my [Patreon](https://patreon.com/DevKyfStoreGames) and join for either of three tiers right now. Either Lite, Pro and Advanced. All of them get special access to my discord server but also they all unlock a special project I'm working on, Fwengine! You can learn more about this on my patreon.
